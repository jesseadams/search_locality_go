Search Locality Problem

As a staff researcher, you must repeatedly search through a set of plain text documents in order to do your work.

A common need is to find documents where two different topics or search terms are discussed in the same context, for example: oncology and morbidity, or virtualization and agility.

"Context" within a document can be ambiguous or ill-defined, but in this case, "context" is defined as the two search terms occurring within N words of each other irrespective of sentence, paragraph or page boundaries.

Using a programming language of your choice, develop a piece of software that can iterate over all the plain text documents in a directory and return the set of documents where two search terms occur within N words of each other.

Extra credit:
In addition to allowing two search terms, allow the user to specify phrases instead of terms, e.g. "Dr. Fowler" and "Continuous Delivery"
